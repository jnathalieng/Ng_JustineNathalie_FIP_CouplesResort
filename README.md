## Final Integrated Project â€“ Couples Resort Website

This Final Integrated Project is a continuation of building the Couples Resort website that was used in class. The requirement for this project was to create three mobile web pages and one desktop web page, all built using static CSS Grid layout. Topic Pages I included were Rooms, Spa Activities, and Packages for the Mobile Desktop. As for the Desktop Page, I made an extra page called Features where all the news articles, guest reviews, and announcements are organized in one page.

## Installation
No Installation required. 
Download Zip File and Extract

## Usage
The navigation links allow users to move between pages easily. I also included a dropdown (select box) for choosing accomodations, a flip card effect on the desktop page that features sustainability inside the Resort, I added Hover effects on learn more buttons, a simple CSS color shift on hover animation for the submit buttons, and a ::after pseudo selector that shows a checkmark after submitting the contact form.
